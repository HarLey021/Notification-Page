## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Styled Components
- Flexbox
- React
- Typescrypt
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

While working on this project, I deepened my knowledge of React, TypeScript, Vite, and styled-components. I learned how to type components properly, manage state with TypeScript interfaces, and structure a modern React project with Vite. Using styled-components, I practiced creating reusable, responsive, and maintainable styles, including handling flex layouts, scrollable areas, and hiding scrollbars across browsers. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of building interactive and visually consistent web interfaces.
